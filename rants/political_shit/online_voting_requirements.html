<h3> Online Voting Requirements</h3>
<p>

<br/><br/>

</p>
<h3> What does an online voting system need?</h3>
<p>

<br/><br/>

- Allow voting multiple times.
Only the last vote should count, but users should be able to vote more than once to reduce the chance of 
coercion. If a user is coerced into voting for X they can then change that vote by casting another vote 
for Y or Z or even blank.

<br/><br/>

- Repudiation. 
A user should not be able to prove who they voted for. Only that their vote has been tallied. This again
is a way to reduce the chances that a vote can been coerced.

<br/><br/>

</p>
<h3> What is nice to have?</h3>
<p>

<br/><br/>

- Allow a user to verify that their vote has been tallied.
After voting a user should be able to check that their vote has been tallied.

<br/><br/>

- Anonymous voting.
No one should be able to know what a user voted. "How is this nice to have?", you may ask. "Voting should
always be anonymous", you might say. I disagree, and here comes my rant that justifies it. It would
definitely be nice if voting was anonymous while keeping with all the other much more necessary features
of online voting, but that is not currently possible and some cryptographers think it will never be. Some
people think that that is enough to disregard online voting, but I think that the benefits of online voting
are too great to pass on just because of this and that we can get good enough anonymity to justify voting
online.

<br/><br/>

When democracy was starting out, and still today in some smaller elections, votes were cast with a show of
hands. This worked well, but there is one big issue which is that people can be coerced into voting for
something they don't agree with. To fix this, we now have paper ballots that we place inside an envelope.
This is great, now our neighbor can't know what we voted for and we don't have to give in into peer pressure,
but does this actually solve the anonymity problem? This solves the most basic problem, which can also be
easily solved for online voting. The bigger issues that we think anonymity solves and why we think it is so
crucial is to tackle interference by government or another large organization.

<br/><br/>

Solving this bigger problem with online voting is potentially impossible, but we can do much better than
with paper ballots. If the government wanted to know what every citizen was voting for they could. Technology
has come a long way and cameras are very small and even if found, it is hard to prove what entity placed
them. Well, that would be a crazy conspiracy and someone would speak up and tell everyone about it. Well,
maybe, but why would that not be the case with online voting? With online voting it can still be hard for
a malicious party to get access to the deanonymized data without a large scale conspiracy. 

<br/><br/>

Okay, so the government can spy on us and know what we voted for, but what about a thug. A criminal organization
could coerce people into voting a particular way. Yes, they could, if we are talking about paper ballots.
With paper ballots a mobsters lackey could be in the voting area making sure that people are picking up the 
"correct" ballot and placing it in envelopes. But, that's illegal, they can't do that. They can, and illegal
is not really an argument against it because election interference is always illegal, whether the election
is online or on paper. This type of election interference is actually made harder with online voting, so 
despite online voting not being perfect it is actually much better than what we currently have.

<br/><br/>

</p>
<h3> What is impossible?</h3>
<p>

<br/><br/>

- Easy to understand
Many people argue that the advantage of paper ballots is that they are very easy to understand and therefore
people can trust it. The truth is, most people have no idea how paper ballots or elections work or how 
election fraud and irregularities are detected using just some votes. The truth is, most people couldn't
count high enough to count votes. Most people don't even know how to divide two numbers with 3 or more digits.
If we could only use technology that is easy to understand we wouldn't even be using fire or the wheel and
the only acceptable form of government would be a military dictatorship: what this person says goes because
big guns.

<br/><br/>

Despite not striving for perfect anonymity an online voting system would still be complex, but it could be
understood and verified by many people. Everyone else would have to trust the people that verify the system,
just like in our current system. Trust, maybe unfortunately, is an essential component of our societies.

<br/><br/>

</p>
<h5> Getting into the weeds. How would the online voting system work?</h5>
<p>

<br/><br/>

The first step, and probably the most complicated, is that every citizen would need a digital signature.
These signatures are already common in many European countries to handle governmental task such as paying
taxes or getting a criminal records certificate. This is the hardest part because people will lose it and/or
not know how to use it. Making the user experience seamless will be very complicated, but the simplest way
I can think of would be that the signature is uploaded to the citizen's mobile phone and they cannot extract it.
The voting app can then use the key, but never read it. This is not magic, this is already something that most 
smartphones can handle. When the user changes their phone or loses it, they would have to go back to the police
or wherever and get another key. For people that prefer to handle their keys themselves, the keys could be
given out in print and the user would then put them on their phone, computer, or memorize it if they please.

<br/><br/>

The first problem that arises from this is that a criminal could require their victims to take a phone given to
them by the criminal, put the keys there and then hand the phone back to the criminal. The solution to this is
that when a new digital signature is issued for a citizen the old one expires and is no longer valid, but when
trying to use it to vote there will be no visible error, the vote will be silently ignored.

<br/><br/>

If we manage to get everyone a digital signature, the rest is straightforward.
Firstly, the app displays the ongoing votes the user selects a vote and then selects their opinion and bam the 
vote with the signature is cast and sent to the server. To make sure that the app is the correct app something
called reproducible builds would be used. Most people will have no idea what that is, but they don't have to.
As long as some people verify the builds and no anomalies are found we can statistically say that the downloadable
app version was not tampered with.

<br/><br/>

Secondly, the server. The server will have the keys to the temple. It will know everything and nothing will be
secret to the server. That is what makes this implementation so simple. In the server nothing is anonymous. It
knows what everyone voted for, making it easy to detect that a user has already voted and therefore this second
vote should override the first and not be added on top of the first. Everything is easy for the server because
there are no secrets. The hard part is making sure that despite the server knowing everything the people in
control of the server can't access this very sensitive information. This amazingly, is also a solved problem.
The information reaches the server encrypted, the server decrypts it and handles it, and when it has to store
information it encrypts it before doing so.

<br/><br/>

It might be necessary to gain access to the voting information. Maybe a problem has been detected and having
access to the information will prove that an election was tampered with. To handle this there would have
a master key that gives people access to the system. This would not be a key that any one person has. The key
can be split amongst N different entities and require at least K of these entities to give their share of the
key to access the system. One of these keys could be given the the supreme court, another to the senate, another
to a random person living on a boat, and only when these people come together can the system be accessed. On
top of that, the server won't actually know that John Doe has cast their vote for Jane Doe, it will know that
a citizen with X digital signature has cast a vote for Jane Doe. So if malicious entities wanted to figure out
what specific people cast a vote for Jane Doe they would need to access the system, get the voting data and then
cross reference this information with information regarding what citizen has which digital signature. By keeping
a close eye on people accessing the unencrypted information on the server and that that information is never
cross referenced we can be pretty sure that no one can know what a particular person voted for.

<br/><br/>

The server, of course, would have to be verified by multiple parties and multiple parties would have to keep an
eye on it to make sure that no one from either the inside or outside can break into the server and interfere 
with the system. 

<br/><br/>

Again, this system would not be a simple system, but it is a feasible system with today's technology and it
could be improved as our knowledge of cryptography improves.

<br/><br/>

</p>
<h5> What if a citizen doesn't have a phone or a computer or anything else?</h5>
<p>

<br/><br/>

For those people, there should be an option to pay by mail. Many places will require some infrastructure
improvements, but given that most people would not vote by mail, it should not be prohibitively expensive.

<br/><br/>

</p>
<h5> An example of how the key could be split in a country like spain would be:</h5>
<p>

<br/><br/>

1. Divide the key into 5 parts. All of these parts are required to access the voting data.
2. Give 1 part to the king and 1 part to the prime minister
3. Divide another of the parts amongst all the members of parliament requiring at least 75% of the subparts to 
recreate the part.
4. Divide another of the parts amongst all the members of the sentate requiring at least 75% of the subparts to 
recreate the part.
5a. 1 of the remaining parts is divided into two parts only needing 1 of these two parts to create the part.
5b. Divide these 2 half parts into another two parts required both quarter parts to create a half part. 
5c. Give one quarter part to the supreme court and its counterpart to a randomly chosen lower court that rotates.
5d. To create the other half part give one quarter part, again, to the supreme court and its counterpart to 
another randomly chosen lower court that rotates.

<br/><br/>

This is just an example and if this voting scheme were implemented the senate and parliament would be very
different or potentially not exist rendering this distribution ineffective, but a different distribution could
be found which makes it very hard for a single entity to act maliciously.
