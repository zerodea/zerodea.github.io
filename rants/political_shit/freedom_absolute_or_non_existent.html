With the emergence of “fake news” governments and individuals are trying to combat it.
I won’t argue whether institutions and people should fight back on “fake news”, but
what is clearly wrong is how our freedoms are being impinged upon using "fake news"
as the excuse. Three situations exists in which people reach out to the excuse of
"fake news" to silence critics: when there's a difference of opinion, when there's
a disagreement on reported facts and when scientifically proven facts are ignored.
What's interesting about the current social landscape is that in all three of these
situations both parties accuse the other of disinformation.

<br/><br/>

When two parties have a difference of opinion it's a cop out to shout "fake news".
It doesn't add anything to the conversation and reduces engagement. It also demonstrates
a lack of interest about the topic; if you can’t be bothered to challenge your own
beliefs why do you expect others to budge on theirs? If you enter a debate without
an open mind and just parroting what you know is right, not only will you not learn
anything new, but you won’t convince anyone you’re right either. The whole reason for
the debate becomes mute when instead of changing your point of view when realizing
your wrong you reach out for the disinformation excuse.

<br/><br/>

Just like when basing our perspective on opinions, when basing our view on reported
facts we have to be open to the opposing point of view and inform ourselves using as
many resources as possible. Keeping ourselves informed of opposing views allows us to
have a more complete opinion, and it also enables us to more easily argue in favor of
our position.

<br/><br/>

Even in the last situation, when someone is scientifically wrong we should still respect
their freedom of speech. Some people argue the earth is flat while others are convinced
the earth is a globe. Regardless of who is right, only one group of people can be backed
by scientific evidence.
