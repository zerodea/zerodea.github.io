<p>
Kotlin is a great language and I have raved about it a lot, but there is a beauty to C.
There is a beauty in doing things "ugly". People hate C because people use goto and
macros suck and pointers to pointers to pointers are a thing, but sometimes having
these tools make things so much easier.

<br/><br/>

Asynchronous code and coroutines are awesome in Kotlin. Flows are beautiful, channels
are simple and not dealing with callbacks is glorious, but there are situations where
C is better. Yes, I said it, C is better than Kotlin in some aspects of asynchronous
code. 

<br/><br/>

Lets say we spawn two asynchronous tasks and we have to wait for them to reach
a certain point of their execution before continuing the main tasks execution. I will
write code that I actually had to deal with in Kotlin, (unnecessary stuff has been omitted):

<br/><br/>

val mutex = Mutex(locked = false)
var remainingObserverSetups = 2

<br/><br/>

launch {
mutex.lock()
flowA
.onSubscription {
remainingObserverSetups--
mutex.unlock()
}
.collect()
}

<br/><br/>

launch {
mutex.lock()
flowB
.onSubscription {
remainingObserverSetups--
mutex.unlock()
}
.collect()
}

<br/><br/>

do {
mutex.lock()
if (remainingObserverSetups == 0) {
mutex.unlock()
break;
}
mutex.unlock()
} while(true)

<br/><br/>


<br/><br/>

There is another option which is to use two different mutexes. Or if we extrapolate
this to many, an array or list of mutexes. The code would then look like this:

<br/><br/>


<br/><br/>

val mutexes = buildList<Mutex>(2) { Mutex(locked = true) }

<br/><br/>

launch {
flowA
.onSubscription {
mutexes[0].unlock() 
}
.collect()
}

<br/><br/>

launch {
mutex.lock()
flowB
.onSubscription {
mutexes[1].unlock()
}
.collect()
}

<br/><br/>

for (mutex in mutexes) {
mutex.lock()
}

<br/><br/>


<br/><br/>

This is shitto. Well, of course it is man, you should use a Semaphore. Yes, that is
what Semaphores are for, but unfortunately Kotlin and many other modern languages
have made the decision to protect users. Therefore they have made Semaphores work
more closely as what they are supposed to do, which is limit the amount of threads
that can access a resource or do something, but made it useless for this situation.

<br/><br/>

In C because we can do what we want we can setup a Semaphore and use that instead
of a weird do-while loop and an unnecessary remainingObserverSetups value or having
an array/list of mutexes. This is what it would look like in C:

<br/><br/>


<br/><br/>

static sem_t sem;

<br/><br/>

void *doStuffFunc(void) {
sem_post(&sem);
}

<br/><br/>

sem_init(&sem, 0, -2);

<br/><br/>

pthread_t t[2];
pthread_create(&t[0], NULL, doStuffFunc, NULL);
pthread_create(&t[1], NULL, doStuffFunc, NULL);

<br/><br/>

sem_wait(&sem);

<br/><br/>


<br/><br/>

The magic of this C code is that we initialize the sempahore to -2 which means
that when we call sem_wait in the main thread it will wait until the 2 spawned
threads have called sem_post. Is this what Semaphores should be used for? I don't
know, but it is awesome that it is allowed and the amount of code and weird things
that have to be done are lower.
