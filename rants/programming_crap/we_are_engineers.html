A common trope, especially amongst software engineers, is that software engineering
is not real engineering. 

<br/><br/>

Lets take bridge building. I think we can all agree that the people that design
bridges are real engineers. Lets work with the fictitious and renowned bridge 
builder, Mr. Van DerBridgen, to figure out what exactly defines an engineer. We call
Mr. Van DerBridgen and comission a bridge to cross a small stream in our garden and
once completed we drop a bomb on it and the bridge crumbles. We turn to Mr. Van
DerBridgen flabbergasted. What happened to our bridge? How can the renowned Mr. Van
DerBridgen be so incompetent, his bridge didn't last a single day. Mr. Van DerBridgen
would rightly point out that the bridge wasn't built with that very peculiar use case
in mind and he would be completely right. Mr. Van DerBridgen could build a bridge
that withstands a bombing, but these situations have to be brought up and discussed.

<br/><br/>

Engineering is a balancing act. An engineers job is to build a product that meets
a spec, or in other words a product that fulfills certain expectations. These
expectations can be summarized as: purpose, cost, and time. What will the product be
used for? What is the budge? What is the deadline? A bridge for people to
cross the stream in your garden that must be built in less than an hour and cost less
than $10 would be a plank of wood. Whereas if we give Mr. Van DerBridgen a million
dollars and a year to build a small footbridge he could produce a work of art.

<br/><br/>

In software we also have great engineers. NASA built two voyagers, the curiosity rover,
and got to the moon and all of these endeavours required software. Software that ran
as well as any other part of the system. Why are these people not engineers? 

<br/><br/>

Many of these people are engineers as well. The problem with most consumer facing
software is the spec. The product must be ready yesterday and run everywhere. It has
to work on every Android device, the 30,000+ of them, on all laptops running any 
operating system, and on all web browsers. The combination of environments is easily
a million. So it has to work on a million devices and it has to keep working as more
environments are created and people are going to try and break it and you have 2
weeks to do it. Oh, and we will change requirements half way through. As engineers,
software engineers bring up these issues, but they have very limited power. The
product "needs" to be built. They can try to remove some features or increase the
deadline, but you can't say "hey, we will make this product and it will only run on
Firefox 120 running on Debian 12". If that was an option we could have software that
works very well, even better than how software runs now, which is already pretty well
all things considered. It is impossible to make software with the expectation most
companies have that is bug free. I once had a great team lead that said: "If we had
100% crash free rate we would be doing something wrong".

<br/><br/>

I would argue that consumer facing software engineering is one of the toughest if not
the toughest engineering discipline. The environment in which software runs is changed
constantly. Imagine if a bridge builder built a bridge on top of rock, but a year later
the foundation was mud, and four months later it was water. How could we expect this
engineer to take these things into account? Even the curiosity rover which is incredible
works in a more confined environment than consumer facing software. Mars has a harsh
environment, but it is an environment that can be accounted for. There are crazy
sandstorms, it's cold, and radiation is higher than on earth. All these things make
creating a rover for mars very complicated, but we know these conditions. If all of a
sudden mars turned into a gas giant for a couple years because God decided to flip a
bit Curiosity rover would fail. 

<br/><br/>

The expectations on consumer facing software are ridiculous. The expectations of neither
the user's nor the employer's can be met because the expectation is that it works for 
everyone. Given that constraint, most engineering value is lost because there is no
realistic spec to work with. Despite this, software engineers do a great job and are
the greatest of all engineering jugglers. They manage to build products that mostly
work, in most environments, fairly quickly and cheaply.
