There was a
a few years ago about colored functions. It has become
so popular that people talk about colored functions in the context of concurrency
and almost everyone in the software business understands what they are talking about.
If you haven't read the article go ahead and read it, it's great (even if it is wrong
in some regards) and necessary to understand my following rant. 

<br/><br/>

Golang devs like to say that their functions are not colored. "We just use go func
and that runs a function as a goroutine without having to think about colors."
That is the biggest horseshit anyone has ever said. If you have a function that
returns a value and try to run that function as a goroutine and wait for the
result you are basically calling go *get* fuct. You have to add a bunch of ceremony
i.e. channels to functions that are going to be called as a goroutine. So by
passing a channel in the declaration of the function you are coloring that function.
You are saying hey this function should be called as a goroutine and you should
wait for the result on this channel. If instead you return a value from the function
then you are telling the user that this function should not be run as a goroutine
and if they do want to run it as a goroutine they should wrap it in their own function
that receives a channel that then calls the function that returns a value and send
that value through the channel. So much for not coloring functions.

<br/><br/>

I'm picking on Golang, but the truth is there is no way around this. How can you
return something from an asynchronous function to another context? You have to use a
channel, as is done in golang, or use whatever mechanism your language of choice uses.
What I am picking on is the fact that by trying to uncolor the functions, and hide
this implicit complexity, instead of improving on the status quo they made it worse.

<br/><br/>

In Kotlin colored functions are called suspendable functions because they can suspend
their execution and are declared by appending `suspend` before the rest of the function
declaration e.g. `suspend fun x()`. Suspendable functions can only be called in a
`CoroutineScope` which requires a `CoroutineContext`. By having to explicitly define the
context we can control whether a coroutine runs in the main thread or a different one. We
can also make sure that various coroutines run on the same thread. This implementation
makes it easier to use threads and provides a lot of benefits, but does not attempt to
oversimplify a hard problem and hide the complexity that exists, it simply makes it easy
to do easy things and making it easier to do hard things.

<br/><br/>

Marking suspendable functions and making the user handle them explicitly brings another
benefit: it indicates that a function "blocks", but doesn't spin. The suspendable
function will yield so other threads can run while waiting as opposed to busy waiting.
In a language such as Go a function could block a thread using busy waiting and the
only way of knowing this would be by reading the documentation. Yes, we should always
RTFD(ocs), but another great rule is that APIs should be easy to use and hard to misuse.
By making the user aware of whether a function uses busy waiting or yields with a simple
coloring you make it harder to misuse the function and end up blocking a computer because
all your threads are busy waiting.

<br/><br/>

Making the coloring explicit like in Kotlin is way better than trying to hide your crayons
like golang does. By coloring your functions explicitly you make it way more clear if a
function is concurrent and should be called within a coroutine, or whether it's a regular
function that can be called in any context. You also make it's design and implementation
explicit by indicating whether the function yields or blocks just with it's signature.
